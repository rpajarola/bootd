HP proprietary Remote Maintenance Protocol

Status

FreeBSD/i386 5.0        working
	tested with HP425t

Notes

The protocol has been reverse-engineered with tcpdump and compared
to the existing rbootd implementation in FreeBSD (which AFAIK has
also been reverse-engineered somehow). Because it has not been
implemented after an official specification, it is probably incomplete
and may not work for certain machines.
