Reverse Address Resolution Protocol

Status

FreeBSD/i386 5.0	working
	tested with SUN SPARCstation 4

Notes

The code in rarp_updatetable has been derived from the FreeBSD rarpd
source (/usr/src/usr.sbin/rarpd/rarpd.c). This part of the code is
still untested (read: not working on my machine), though it seems
this is not strictly necessary.
